# HTTPServer

## Creating an HTTP Server
For this assignment, you will be building your own HTTP server that implements HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616)!

You don't have to read the whole RFC, but you do need to understand the following:

- HTTP Message Structure
- HTTP Request-Line and Status-Line
- HTTP Methods
- HTTP Headers (Content-Type and Content-Length)
- MIME Types
- Status Codes
 
Create a Github repo named HTTPServer and upload your HTTP Server source code.

 Includes https://http.cat/ images as the body of HTML pages sent back with an error code
